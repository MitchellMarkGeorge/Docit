# Docit 

A Version Control System for Work Documents (based on/ inspired by Git)

To run, simply clone this repo, run ``npm install`` and ``npm run global``. After that, simply type ``docit`` in your command line and the help will guide you.

I was planning on making this into a library as well, and maybe use it in an Electron app ðŸ˜‰.
